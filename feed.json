				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.appshubforvisuallyimpaired.com/call-of-fate\">Call of Fate</a> is Prudence&rsquo;s second audio game widely available to the western English speaking market; the first was Ranger Legend.  Unfortunately, I found Ranger Legend to be confusing, difficult, and slightly buggy.  I&rsquo;m pleased to say that despite some flaws, Call Of Fate is a much better outing!</p>\n<p>Call of Fate is a cultivation style progression game, with automatic battles and a lot of resource management.  It does an excellent job hitting that &ldquo;make numbers go up!&rdquo; feeling that I suspect most players are looking for from this sort of game.  There are so many different types of diamonds and crystals and tokens and coins that you&rsquo;re pretty much always getting a large reward of something.  There are even wish tokens and advanced wish tokens that can be turned in for randomized rewards.</p>\n<p>The sound design is also excellent.  Even without a learn sounds menu, it&rsquo;s possible to tell what&rsquo;s happening just by listening to the battles.  At least on IOS, the 3d panning plus spatial audio really brings the battles to life, and makes all those reward sounds pop.  The interface sounds provide excellent queues while navigating the games deep menu structure, making quickly developing muscle memory easy.</p>\n<p>While still somewhat awkward in some places, the English translation is good enough that western players won&rsquo;t find themselves lost at any point.  The primary issue is a lack of consistency; sometimes the name of some characters is written in romanized Chinese, and sometimes the same character name gets translated into English words. Similarly, sometimes the character class is called cleric, sometimes pastor, and once or twice healer. Sometimes the interface calls improving your character training, and sometimes it calls it cultivating.</p>\n<p>As with many casual mobile games, Call of Fate does have microtransactions and a premium currency.  If you&rsquo;re focused on the leaderboards, I could see it feeling pay to win.  But the game is generous enough with its premium currency that I&rsquo;ve never felt pressured to pay just to progress, and no content or activity is locked behind a paywall.  If you&rsquo;re going to pay for anything, get the monthly card in order to unlock several quality of life features that will save your fingers a few minutes of clicking and swiping each day.</p>\n<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve talked about the positives, let&rsquo;s talk about the more neutral aspects, followed by some of the flaws.  First off, I have to talk about the story and game world.  I have a deep background in the Tolkien enspired mythos that most western stories and games take place in, and almost no exposure to Chinese fantasy at all, so a lot of this is just my personal impressions and opinions.</p>\n<p>When playing a Tolkien enspired RPG, there are things that I just accept as the way the world is. Of course I can find boots that make me smarter, gloves that make my prayers more effective, and a wristband that makes me faster. Dwarves live underground and drink, trolls are smelly and stupid, and vampires are vulnerable to sunlight.  Players don&rsquo;t even need these things documented anywhere&hellip;it&rsquo;s just obvious.  But when playing Call of Fate, all of the various crystals and metals and tokens and things, combined with the unsaid assumptions, throw me for a loop. For example, S rank is better than A rank. Why? Who knows! The game never tells you this, you&rsquo;re just expected to already have this knowledge. Why does ranking up destroy all of your meterials? Where are they going! Are my characters&hellip;eating crystals and golden tokens? Because these mechanics are less familiar to me, I find them a bit harder to accept than a necklace that increases dexterity by five, or leveling up just making you more armored for no reason.  Also, taking potions is fine with me. But when my heroes constantly eat stamina pills, I keep picturing them as a bunch of ninja drug addicts.</p>\n<p>And that leads me into the story.  This story is&hellip;is&hellip;indescribable.  If you think about it too hard, your head might easily explode.  I keep thinking that the translation must be to blame for something, and then the game confirms that&hellip;it said <em>exactly</em> what it meant.  So you just have to accept that the garden of Eden was created by the Norse God Oden as a prison to trap his arch enemy&hellip;Nikola Tesla.  Tesla is possessed by an electricity demon, and the garden of eden is defended by mechanical birds, because why not? It called Eden the realm of man at one point, so I was sure that I was dealing with a mistranslation, and this wasn&rsquo;t the actual garden of Eden from the Bible. &hellip;And then I had to fight the forbidden fruit nymph who popped out of a stone apple and demanded that Adam be returned to her. I&rsquo;m terrified that at some point Jesus is going to turn up, the game will confirm that pastor is the correct translation of the healer class, and the magical mermaid Aria is an Episcopalian.  Is&hellip;is this normal?  Are all Chinese fantasies like this? Or did the developers consume one too many stamina pills?  To be fair, if you asked me to write something referencing Chinese mythological characters, I&rsquo;m not sure I could even name a single one.  I certainly couldn&rsquo;t come up with Tesla battling Oden.  Anyway, excuse me while I fly my airplane to the city of the Sky Gods to&hellip;ummm&hellip;I actually forget what my goal is supposed to be. But whatever it is, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll involve fighting more evil robots.</p>\n<p>Right, now onto the things that seem more like flaws.  First off, all of the characters have voice acted introduction lines as you unlock them, and death quotes when they die in battle. I was a little disappointed that there isn&rsquo;t any English voice acting in the game, or even a text-based translation of the voice acted lines. I realize they&rsquo;re just flavour, but it&rsquo;d still be nice.</p>\n<p>Second, once you progress a little bit in the game, the automatic battles take forever!  Yes, they do sound neat with headphones. But listening to them for ten minutes is excessive.  It&rsquo;s possible that because I have two clerics in my party I keep healing, and so everything takes ages.  Never the less, I often find myself starting a battle, putting down my phone, and wandering off to make lunch.  It would be nice to speed these up or skip them or something.</p>\n<p>Third, the game has dozens of systems, and they don&rsquo;t all feel as connected as I would like. There&rsquo;s some kind of territory system where I command my servants and upgrade my lands, multiple challenge towers and towers of trials (why is everything always a tower?), a couple of different pvp tournaments, a guild system with multiple activities (including something called &ldquo;suppressing the guild nightmare&rdquo;&hellip;does the guild have trouble sleeping or something? How do magical battles help it rest?), dispatch missions, dungeons to clear, monthly challenges, daily challenges, timed challenges, and probably more I&rsquo;m forgetting.  Each of these different things has different stats and levels, awards different tokens and coins and materials, and requires different upgrades.  It doesn&rsquo;t always feel like upgrading one thing is effecting any of my massive variety of other things.  Maybe it is, though, and I&rsquo;m just confused.  There are still lots of stats I have no idea what they do, and tons of orbs and crystals and currencies and tokens that I haven&rsquo;t even found a use for, yet.</p>\n<p>In short, if you&rsquo;re in the mood for a long and sprawling game, with neat sound design, and a bunch of&hellip;stuff, check out Call of Fate.

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved golden-age pulp science fiction.  Unfortunately, the scans of magazines like astounding are generally of poor enough quality that standard OCR struggles with them.</p>\n<p>So I thought: what better use for AI than reading public domain science fiction?  I downloaded a <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/sim_astounding-science-fiction_1955-03_55_1\">random issue of Astounding Science Fiction and Fantasy from the internet archive</a>, this one printed in 1955. I started by grabbing the PDF.</p>\n<p>First, I tried uploading it to Chat GPT with the following prompt: &ldquo;I love reading golden age science fiction from the public domain. Unfortunately, the magazine scans are generally not accessible, and the OCR doesn&rsquo;t do a good job. Could you produce an accessible version of this PDF?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It responded &ldquo;I’ve converted the March 1955 issue of Astounding Science Fiction into an accessible plain text version. You can download it using the link below&rdquo;. Unfortunately, the .txt file it offered me consisted of&hellip;74,498 blank lines. When I informed it of this fact, it tried to just run an OCR tool on the PDF. But that produced identical results to the OCR done by archive.org. In both cases, the first page reads like this: &ldquo;March 1955 - 35 Cents ‘ Astoundinc\nBCIENCE FICTIOw | Sense From Thnucht Nivide .. &hellip;&hellip; —_—&rdquo;.  Not really readable!</p>\n<p>So I tried Google Gemini 2.5. It was more promising! It began outputting perfect versions of each page, with everything nicely marked for screen readers.  Unfortunately, it got to page 12 and timed out. Also, it sighted the source of every paragraph with a footnote that lead back to the PDF. Yes, Gemini, I know that the text came from the PDF I just uploaded to you! This is also annoying to read with a screen reader. It&rsquo;s output looks like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Astounding SCIENCE FICTION\nVolume LV, Number 1 - March 1955\n(Cover)\n• Image: Sense From Thought Divide\n• Price: 35 Cents\n(Page 2 - Advertisement)\n• NICK CARTER MASTER DETECTIVE\n• Suspense-packed case histories with America&rsquo;s top fictional sleuth.\n• SUNDAYS 4:30 pm EST\n• MUTUAL Broadcasting System MBS</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I figured: the timeout is probably because I&rsquo;m using the official gemini interface.

I gave it the PDF file and the prompt, and it did the same thing Chat GPT did, and just performed basic OCR.  So I asked: &ldquo;There are lots of OCR errors.

				"title": "Review: The Deco BE95 from the perspective of a voiceover user",
				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been a happy customer of the <a href=\"https://amplifi.com/alien\">Amplifi Alien</a> routers since they were released in December 2019.  However, they haven&rsquo;t received an upgrade since then; that means they have no support for Wifi 6E or Wifi 7.  So when one of my alien units broke, I decided it was time to invest in an entirely new mesh system now that I own Wifi 7 capable devices.  If you&rsquo;re looking for a used router on the cheap, though, I would strongly advise keeping an eye out for Amplifi Alien units. As early adopters like me begin to upgrade, I would expect to see a lot of perfectly good Wifi6 mesh router systems going for bargain prices.  The app is decently accessible, they make sounds when they reboot or lose connection, and they&rsquo;re rock solid once you get them going.  The thing that kills them is the fan. My routers go in a corner somewhere and get forgotten.  So as the fans got clogged with dust, I failed to notice until the router overheated and stopped working. If you&rsquo;re a better owner than I am, the fan openings are obvious and easy to clean.</p>\n<p>But the Alien isn&rsquo;t the subject of this article.  Let&rsquo;s move on to actually talking about what the title promises.  In order to replace the Amplifi Routers, I did consider the <a href=\"https://ca.store.ui.com/ca/en/products/udm-pro\">Ubiquity Dream Machine</a>. However, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of criticism of the controller app for being inaccessible with screen readers.  Also, Ubiquity stuff requires a lot more setup and management.  While I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;m capable of it, network access is absolutely critical to everyone in this house.  With two blind people living here, we&rsquo;ve invested heavily into the smart-home, if only to get devices that we can at least use via an app.  So our network is extremely busy, with tons of devices active at once, and when the network goes down, we can&rsquo;t control everything from the oven to the furnace.  I decided against building my own router with FreeBSD for similar reasons.</p>\n<p>So I went looking for routers with an accessible interface that supported Wifi7 mesh, and required as little on-going management as possible.  A review on <a href=\"https://www.applevis.com/apps/ios/utilities/tp-link-deco\">Applevis</a> suggested that the TP-Link Deco app might meet my accessibility requirements.  Researching TP-Link&rsquo;s product offerings, it looked like the <a href=\"https://www.tp-link.com/ca/home-networking/deco/deco-be95\">Deco BE95</a> would provide everything I was looking for.</p>\n<p>After owning the units for a month now, I can say that I was correct!  Before talking about all the good things, though, let&rsquo;s start off with the bad.  First, the price.  These are not cheap routers!  The hardware itself is more expensive than either Amplifi or Ubiquity gear with similar specs. Plus, on top of the purchase price, there&rsquo;s also a monthly subscription if you want some of the advanced security features.  I obviously paid the early adopter tax here. While I&rsquo;m fine with paying for routers that will last six or seven years without me ever having to touch them, be aware that there are cheaper ways to get the same features if you&rsquo;re willing to put in the work.</p>\n<p>Second, the out of the box setup experience could be better.  While the app is, in fact, accessible, you do need to get someone to look at lights for you to know when the first router is ready for pairing.  But once you&rsquo;ve got the first one up, the app will notify you when your mesh unit is ready to be added.  I also disliked the default DHCP settings, and found changing them was a fiddley process that required modifying things in two separate sections of the settings.  Even after changing the DHCP settings to work with my network, the router requires a different netmask, so I had to go and modify all of my static devices that weren&rsquo;t using DHCP.  If none of that meant anything to you, don&rsquo;t worry about it; the router should just work out of the box for you.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the paid security features. If having to pay a monthly router subscription isn&rsquo;t bad enough, the features just aren&rsquo;t as useful as they should be for the price.  They do include a dynamically updated blocklist, to block phishing and other security issues at the router. I have some older folks who sometimes use my network, so the feature is appreciated.  Unfortunately, though, the router provides no whitelist. If the security blocks a false positive, your only option is to turn it off entirely.  The router also provides an EOT protection feature. But nowhere that I can find does it explain what the feature actually does. I can say that in my setup it didn&rsquo;t break anything, so that&rsquo;s good. But what is it actually protecting me against? Who knows!  As part of this feature, the router provides weekly and monthly reports on my network.  Once again, though, this feature isn&rsquo;t as useful as I would like it to be.  It does include threats blocked, but even when I have the security features turned on, it constantly reminds me to scan my network and turn them on. It also reports on number of new devices connected, though it seems to struggle with naming them.  But what it doesn&rsquo;t do is provide me with a network speed report for the week or month.  That means I still have to keep my <a href=\"https://help.fing.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418409261458-Fingbox-Set-up-and-features\">fingbox</a>.  As I pay a subscription to Fing already, it would have been nice if the Deco could have replaced those functions entirely.  It&rsquo;s really close, but just not quite there.  Perhaps software updates will add the missing features.</p>\n<p>With the bad stuff out of the way, let&rsquo;s talk about the good!

				"content_text": "I've been a happy customer of the [Amplifi Alien](https://amplifi.com/alien) routers since they were released in December 2019.  However, they haven't received an upgrade since then; that means they have no support for Wifi 6E or Wifi 7.  So when one of my alien units broke, I decided it was time to invest in an entirely new mesh system now that I own Wifi 7 capable devices.  If you're looking for a used router on the cheap, though, I would strongly advise keeping an eye out for Amplifi Alien units. As early adopters like me begin to upgrade, I would expect to see a lot of perfectly good Wifi6 mesh router systems going for bargain prices.  The app is decently accessible, they make sounds when they reboot or lose connection, and they're rock solid once you get them going.  The thing that kills them is the fan. My routers go in a corner somewhere and get forgotten.  So as the fans got clogged with dust, I failed to notice until the router overheated and stopped working. If you're a better owner than I am, the fan openings are obvious and easy to clean.  \r\n\r\nBut the Alien isn't the subject of this article.  Let's move on to actually talking about what the title promises.  In order to replace the Amplifi Routers, I did consider the [Ubiquity Dream Machine](https://ca.store.ui.com/ca/en/products/udm-pro). However, I've heard a lot of criticism of the controller app for being inaccessible with screen readers.  Also, Ubiquity stuff requires a lot more setup and management.  While I'm certain I'm capable of it, network access is absolutely critical to everyone in this house.  With two blind people living here, we've invested heavily into the smart-home, if only to get devices that we can at least use via an app.  So our network is extremely busy, with tons of devices active at once, and when the network goes down, we can't control everything from the oven to the furnace.  I decided against building my own router with FreeBSD for similar reasons.  \r\n\r\nSo I went looking for routers with an accessible interface that supported Wifi7 mesh, and required as little on-going management as possible.  A review on [Applevis](https://www.applevis.com/apps/ios/utilities/tp-link-deco) suggested that the TP-Link Deco app might meet my accessibility requirements.  Researching TP-Link's product offerings, it looked like the [Deco BE95](https://www.tp-link.com/ca/home-networking/deco/deco-be95) would provide everything I was looking for.  \r\n\r\nAfter owning the units for a month now, I can say that I was correct!  Before talking about all the good things, though, let's start off with the bad.  First, the price.  These are not cheap routers!  The hardware itself is more expensive than either Amplifi or Ubiquity gear with similar specs. Plus, on top of the purchase price, there's also a monthly subscription if you want some of the advanced security features.  I obviously paid the early adopter tax here. While I'm fine with paying for routers that will last six or seven years without me ever having to touch them, be aware that there are cheaper ways to get the same features if you're willing to put in the work.  \r\n\r\nSecond, the out of the box setup experience could be better.  While the app is, in fact, accessible, you do need to get someone to look at lights for you to know when the first router is ready for pairing.  But once you've got the first one up, the app will notify you when your mesh unit is ready to be added.  I also disliked the default DHCP settings, and found changing them was a fiddley process that required modifying things in two separate sections of the settings.  Even after changing the DHCP settings to work with my network, the router requires a different netmask, so I had to go and modify all of my static devices that weren't using DHCP.  If none of that meant anything to you, don't worry about it; the router should just work out of the box for you.  \r\n\r\nLastly, the paid security features. If having to pay a monthly router subscription isn't bad enough, the features just aren't as useful as they should be for the price.  They do include a dynamically updated blocklist, to block phishing and other security issues at the router. I have some older folks who sometimes use my network, so the feature is appreciated.  Unfortunately, though, the router provides no whitelist. If the security blocks a false positive, your only option is to turn it off entirely.  The router also provides an EOT protection feature. But nowhere that I can find does it explain what the feature actually does. I can say that in my setup it didn't break anything, so that's good. But what is it actually protecting me against? Who knows!  As part of this feature, the router provides weekly and monthly reports on my network.  Once again, though, this feature isn't as useful as I would like it to be.  It does include threats blocked, but even when I have the security features turned on, it constantly reminds me to scan my network and turn them on. It also reports on number of new devices connected, though it seems to struggle with naming them.  But what it doesn't do is provide me with a network speed report for the week or month.  That means I still have to keep my [fingbox](https://help.fing.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418409261458-Fingbox-Set-up-and-features).  As I pay a subscription to Fing already, it would have been nice if the Deco could have replaced those functions entirely.  It's really close, but just not quite there.  Perhaps software updates will add the missing features.  \r\n\r\nWith the bad stuff out of the way, let's talk about the good!  First, just as Applevis indicated, the app is pretty much fully accessible. There are a few places where the back button is missing a label, and one spot where the graphs are hard to read.  But that aside, everything works perfectly.  The settings include everything from QoS to port forwarding and VLANs, and they're all logically laid out and easy to find.  I tripped over updating the DHCP range, because I had to change the router's LAN IP first, but it all made sense; I just wasn't expecting it.  The Deco's also provide a web-based user interface, though not all settings are available there.  \r\n\r\nMy ISP offers a 3.5 gig fiber connection. However, in an oddity, it requires PPPOE. One issue I often run into is that a lot of routers aren't well enough equipped with CPU and RAM to handle the PPPOE overhead while giving me full speed on both wired and wifi.  I can say with pleasure that's not the case for Deco. I get my full speed, with lots of CPU and RAM to spare. That also means that while the units themselves get warm, the fans never have to run.  \r\n\r\nThe routers have been managing my entire network for a month now, and they've only crashed twice.

However, removing some devices from QoS fixed that right up.  \r\n\r\nThe backhaul between the mesh units is highly configurable.

This is the first mesh system I've had where speeds on the mesh units are exactly as fast as the wireless speeds when connected to the primary router.

They can also back-up your settings to the cloud, just in case.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for stable, fast wifi, with quick set-up and almost no on-going maintenance, and you're okay with paying a high price for it, the Deco's are an excellent option.  They're accessible, never need rebooting, and compatible with everything I threw at them.

				"title": "My Accessible Self-hosting Tech Stack",
				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been hosting services for myself and others for over 25 years now: starting on IIS6, moving to Windows Server, eventually to Debian, and now to an entirely dockerized stack.  Self-hosting allows me to control my destiny in a way that using cloud services run by others doesn&rsquo;t.  If an update causes screenreader issues, I can just not apply it. If I don&rsquo;t like the default themes, I can change them. In most cases, the projects I host are open-source, meaning I can contribute fixes myself, or write plugins to meet my specific accessibility needs.  In this article, I&rsquo;ll go over the tech choices I&rsquo;ve currently made, why I made those choices, and how they&rsquo;re working out for me.  As it can be disappointing to set up and configure an app for hosting, only to find out it doesn&rsquo;t work with your screenreader, I thought it would be a good idea to document what I&rsquo;m currently using.  If you&rsquo;re interested in taking the same control yourself, or just curious about the accessibility of the self-hosting landscape, I hope you&rsquo;ll find this post useful and informative.</p>\n<p>Note:  where I mention paid services, I have no relationship with those companies and organizations beyond being a customer.  I intentionally did not include referral codes, and I receive no compensation for discussing them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dns-email-and-domains\">DNS, email, and Domains</h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been a satisfied customer of <a href=\"https://easydns.com\">EasyDNS</a> for all of my DNS and domain hosting needs since 2004.  Their legacy control panels have always been fully accessible, and when they rolled out the new beta of the DNS editor, it was completely accessible from the get-go.  I&rsquo;ve also used their email hosting for several projects, and had excellent delivery rates, with well-supported and documented imap and smtp settings that have always worked with the email clients of my choice.  The few times I&rsquo;ve needed to interact with support they&rsquo;ve been friendly, quick, and helpful.  Plus, they&rsquo;re a Canadian company with offices in Toronto that&rsquo;s been around since 1998.  What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>\n<h3 id=\"vps-hosting\">VPS Hosting</h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always avoided the major clouds as hosting providers; I want my data hosted in Canada, and I want to support small businesses. This has meant I&rsquo;ve moved servers many times over the years, as companies come and go.  While it&rsquo;s a bit of effort, at least it means I know my backup and migration strategies work well!  My current pick for server hosting is <a href=\"https://servarica.com\">ServaRica</a>.  The website is largely accessible, the prices are reasonable, support is quick, and the data center is in Montreal.  They also offer specialized VPS plans for applications that require large amounts of storage, meaning I don&rsquo;t have to purchase storage from S3.</p>\n<h3 id=\"management-and-orchestration\">Management and Orchestration</h3>\n<p>The solution I&rsquo;m currently happiest with for managing everything is <a href=\"https://cosmos-cloud.io\">Cosmos Cloud</a>.  Perfectly suited for individuals and small organizations, it gives you a reverse proxy, VPN, single sign on provider, backups, a firewall, and web-based docker management and monitoring out of the box.  Best of all, it uses standard tools behind the scenes.  If it doesn&rsquo;t offer a feature or app I need, or part of the web interface has accessibility issues, I can fall back to the command line, and everything will remain just as integrated as if I&rsquo;d used Cosmos Cloud&rsquo;s management interface.  That&rsquo;s not only an accessibility win, it also means that I&rsquo;m not locked into Cosmos Cloud if I&rsquo;d ever like to change things down the road.</p>\n<h3 id=\"file-storage-and-sync\">File Storage and Sync</h3>\n<p>In order to get files where they need to be, and keep the things that need keeping, I currently use a combination of <a href=\"https://rclone.org\">rClone</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ipfs/kubo\">Kubo</a>.  My eventual hopes and dreams are to move everything over to NFS and ZFS, but that&rsquo;s going to be a good deal of planning and work that I just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to mapping out yet.  In the meantime, rClone works well for moving large files like backups around, and Kubo makes for a decent combination of storage provider and CDN.</p>\n<h3 id=\"my-home-on-the-fediverse\">My Home on The Fediverse</h3>\n<p>There is a massive community of people with disabilities, accessibility practitioners, and fellow leftists on Mastodon and other Activity pub compatible services.  In order to interact with them, I host my identity (@fastfinge@interfree.ca) using <a href=\"https://iceshrimp.dev/iceshrimp/iceshrimp.net\">Iceshrimp.NET</a>.  While the accessibility of the built-in interface isn&rsquo;t yet perfect, Iceshrimp.NET uses an API first model of development.  That means it&rsquo;s fully compatible with all of my favourite apps (Enafore in my case), and even has swagger built-in to help me understand and interact with any Iceshrimp.NET specific endpoints.  As a bonus, it&rsquo;s even written in C#, a language I enjoy working with.  Unless you depend on Tweesecake or TWBlue, two apps that only support standard Mastodon, I strongly encourage giving iceshrimp.NET a look if you&rsquo;d like to host your own fediverse server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"forums\">Forums</h3>\n<p>Of course, I also host the servers for <a href=\"https://www.rblind.com\">RBlind</a>, a <a href=\"https://join-lemmy.org\">Lemmy</a> instance.  In general, the developers are responsive to accessibility feedback, and updates and maintenance are quick and easy.  However, Lemmy is by far the service I host that takes the largest amount of resource, both in disc space and ram.  As well, deploying Lemmy yourself without following the developer provided templates can be a bit fiddly; different URLs need to go to different services, based not just on the hostname or path of the URL, but also on the HTTP headers provided by the client.  It&rsquo;s also important to know that the Lemmy developers are tanky style communists, with a track record of genocide denial, revisionist history, and censorship.  But that doesn&rsquo;t affect the overall code quality or the ability to file bugs and pull requests.  It&rsquo;s possible to run the software without supporting the views of the creators.  In my opinion, that&rsquo;s the entire point of open-source selfhosting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chat\">Chat</h3>\n<p>In an excess of optimism, I run the <a href=\"https://ergo.chat/about\">Ergo</a> IRC server, as it&rsquo;s the server that supports the largest number of the <a href=\"https://ircv3.net/software/servers\">IRCV3</a> features.  However, as most projects don&rsquo;t use IRC anymore, I also run the <a href=\"https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit\">Conduwuit</a> matrix homeserver.  While Ergo was easy to set up and never breaks, getting Conduwuit to even run took me hours and hours. Conduwuit still restarts once an hour or so, sometimes randomly loses my encryption keys, and I have absolutely no idea why.  I pride myself on keeping up with modern technology&hellip;but IRC is one of my &ldquo;old man yells at cloud&rdquo; moments.  It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s easy, and it just works!  Why does everyone want Matrix, again?  IRC was good enough for us in 1995, and it remains good enough for us today!</p>\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Notes</h3>\n<p>For secure storage and sharing of notes, I&rsquo;m using <a href=\"https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/packages/server/README.md\">Joplin</a>.  All of the cross-platform clients are accessible, the server is easy to set up, and the encryption offers security without getting in the way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rss\">RSS</h3>\n<p>My RSS reader of choice is <a href=\"https://miniflux.app\">Miniflux</a>.  It works with all of the major RSS readers, as well as having a minimalist and accessible web interface that&rsquo;s a delight to use.  It&rsquo;s a single, self-contained binary that&rsquo;s quick and doesn&rsquo;t require many resources other than a small PostgreSQL database.</p>\n<h3 id=\"url-shortening\">URL Shortening</h3>\n<p>While URL shorteners aren&rsquo;t ideal, either from a security or preservation perspective, they&rsquo;re still sometimes needed. The increased character limit of Mastodon and other social networks has obviated the need for them online, but they&rsquo;re still useful in person.  If I&rsquo;m giving a URL out over the phone, posting it on a sign or poster, or mentioning it during a presentation, I like to have a custom and easy to remember web address.  I use <a href=\"https://github.com/Lynx-Shortener/Lynx\">Lynx</a> for this purpose, largely because it doesn&rsquo;t come with much built-in tracking.  I neither need or want to know the country, browser, operating system, and underwear size of anyone who uses one of my shortened URLs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"file-distribution\">File Distribution</h3>\n<p>When I need to distribute files too large for email attachments, I use <a href=\"https://github.com/eikek/sharry\">Sharry</a>. It allows for password protected and time limited files, direct downloads or a fancy page with previews, offering multiple files through a single link, and providing a way for others to upload large files to me.  It does all the things that services like sendspace are otherwise known for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bookmark-management\">Bookmark Management</h3>\n<p>I store both my bookmarks and my reading list in <a href=\"https://readeck.org/en\">readeck</a>.  The major advantage is that it has a browser extension, allowing me to bookmark and save the page my browser actually received.  In the current environment of AI crawlers and website blocking, any bookmarking app without this feature is at a major disadvantage.  While I do wish it had a way for me to publicly share my recent bookmarks, it does absolutely everything else I want from a bookmarks and reading list manager.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bluesky-pds\">Bluesky PDS</h3>\n<p>While I agree with the general sentiment that Bluesky is neither federated &rsquo;nor distributed, I never the less run a <a href=\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds\">personal data server</a> to take what little control of my data I can.  However, as bluesky allows you to use your own domain without hosting anything, it kind of feels like all I&rsquo;m doing is saving the for-profit Bluesky corporation a little bit of money on their storage bill.  There aren&rsquo;t any apps that do anything special with a PDS, any way to export your data or keys, or any other advantage to selfhosting on Bluesky.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nvdaremoteserver\">NVDARemoteServer</h3>\n<p>As I do sometimes need to access my machines remotely, I run <a href=\"https://github.com/jmdaweb/NVDARemoteServer\">NVDA Remote Server</a>.

				"content_text": "I've been hosting services for myself and others for over 25 years now: starting on IIS6, moving to Windows Server, eventually to Debian, and now to an entirely dockerized stack.  Self-hosting allows me to control my destiny in a way that using cloud services run by others doesn't.  If an update causes screenreader issues, I can just not apply it. If I don't like the default themes, I can change them. In most cases, the projects I host are open-source, meaning I can contribute fixes myself, or write plugins to meet my specific accessibility needs.  In this article, I'll go over the tech choices I've currently made, why I made those choices, and how they're working out for me.  As it can be disappointing to set up and configure an app for hosting, only to find out it doesn't work with your screenreader, I thought it would be a good idea to document what I'm currently using.  If you're interested in taking the same control yourself, or just curious about the accessibility of the self-hosting landscape, I hope you'll find this post useful and informative.  \n\nNote:  where I mention paid services, I have no relationship with those companies and organizations beyond being a customer.  I intentionally did not include referral codes, and I receive no compensation for discussing them.  \n\n### DNS, email, and Domains ###\n\nI've been a satisfied customer of [EasyDNS](https://easydns.com) for all of my DNS and domain hosting needs since 2004.  Their legacy control panels have always been fully accessible, and when they rolled out the new beta of the DNS editor, it was completely accessible from the get-go.  I've also used their email hosting for several projects, and had excellent delivery rates, with well-supported and documented imap and smtp settings that have always worked with the email clients of my choice.  The few times I've needed to interact with support they've been friendly, quick, and helpful.  Plus, they're a Canadian company with offices in Toronto that's been around since 1998.  What's not to love?  \n\n### VPS Hosting ###\n\nI've always avoided the major clouds as hosting providers; I want my data hosted in Canada, and I want to support small businesses. This has meant I've moved servers many times over the years, as companies come and go.  While it's a bit of effort, at least it means I know my backup and migration strategies work well!  My current pick for server hosting is [ServaRica](https://servarica.com).  The website is largely accessible, the prices are reasonable, support is quick, and the data center is in Montreal.  They also offer specialized VPS plans for applications that require large amounts of storage, meaning I don't have to purchase storage from S3.  \n\n### Management and Orchestration ###\n\nThe solution I'm currently happiest with for managing everything is [Cosmos Cloud](https://cosmos-cloud.io).  Perfectly suited for individuals and small organizations, it gives you a reverse proxy, VPN, single sign on provider, backups, a firewall, and web-based docker management and monitoring out of the box.  Best of all, it uses standard tools behind the scenes.  If it doesn't offer a feature or app I need, or part of the web interface has accessibility issues, I can fall back to the command line, and everything will remain just as integrated as if I'd used Cosmos Cloud's management interface.  That's not only an accessibility win, it also means that I'm not locked into Cosmos Cloud if I'd ever like to change things down the road.  \n\n### File Storage and Sync ###\n\nIn order to get files where they need to be, and keep the things that need keeping, I currently use a combination of [rClone](https://rclone.org) and [Kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo).  My eventual hopes and dreams are to move everything over to NFS and ZFS, but that's going to be a good deal of planning and work that I just haven't gotten around to mapping out yet.  In the meantime, rClone works well for moving large files like backups around, and Kubo makes for a decent combination of storage provider and CDN.  \n\n### My Home on The Fediverse ###\n\nThere is a massive community of people with disabilities, accessibility practitioners, and fellow leftists on Mastodon and other Activity pub compatible services.  In order to interact with them, I host my identity (@fastfinge@interfree.ca) using [Iceshrimp.NET](https://iceshrimp.dev/iceshrimp/iceshrimp.net).  While the accessibility of the built-in interface isn't yet perfect, Iceshrimp.NET uses an API first model of development.  That means it's fully compatible with all of my favourite apps (Enafore in my case), and even has swagger built-in to help me understand and interact with any Iceshrimp.NET specific endpoints.  As a bonus, it's even written in C#, a language I enjoy working with.  Unless you depend on Tweesecake or TWBlue, two apps that only support standard Mastodon, I strongly encourage giving iceshrimp.NET a look if you'd like to host your own fediverse server.  \n\n### Forums ###\n\nOf course, I also host the servers for [RBlind](https://www.rblind.com), a [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org) instance.  In general, the developers are responsive to accessibility feedback, and updates and maintenance are quick and easy.  However, Lemmy is by far the service I host that takes the largest amount of resource, both in disc space and ram.  As well, deploying Lemmy yourself without following the developer provided templates can be a bit fiddly; different URLs need to go to different services, based not just on the hostname or path of the URL, but also on the HTTP headers provided by the client.  It's also important to know that the Lemmy developers are tanky style communists, with a track record of genocide denial, revisionist history, and censorship.  But that doesn't affect the overall code quality or the ability to file bugs and pull requests.  It's possible to run the software without supporting the views of the creators.  In my opinion, that's the entire point of open-source selfhosting.  \n\n### Chat ###\n\nIn an excess of optimism, I run the [Ergo](https://ergo.chat/about) IRC server, as it's the server that supports the largest number of the [IRCV3](https://ircv3.net/software/servers) features.  However, as most projects don't use IRC anymore, I also run the [Conduwuit](https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit) matrix homeserver.  While Ergo was easy to set up and never breaks, getting Conduwuit to even run took me hours and hours.

IRC was good enough for us in 1995, and it remains good enough for us today!  \n\n### Notes ###\n\nFor secure storage and sharing of notes, I'm using [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/packages/server/README.md).  All of the cross-platform clients are accessible, the server is easy to set up, and the encryption offers security without getting in the way.  \n\n### RSS ###\n\nMy RSS reader of choice is [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app).  It works with all of the major RSS readers, as well as having a minimalist and accessible web interface that's a delight to use.  It's a single, self-contained binary that's quick and doesn't require many resources other than a small PostgreSQL database.  \n\n### URL Shortening ###\n\nWhile URL shorteners aren't ideal, either from a security or preservation perspective, they're still sometimes needed. The increased character limit of Mastodon and other social networks has obviated the need for them online, but they're still useful in person.  If I'm giving a URL out over the phone, posting it on a sign or poster, or mentioning it during a presentation, I like to have a custom and easy to remember web address.

It allows for password protected and time limited files, direct downloads or a fancy page with previews, offering multiple files through a single link, and providing a way for others to upload large files to me.  It does all the things that services like sendspace are otherwise known for.  \n\n### Bookmark Management ###\n\nI store both my bookmarks and my reading list in [readeck](https://readeck.org/en).  The major advantage is that it has a browser extension, allowing me to bookmark and save the page my browser actually received.  In the current environment of AI crawlers and website blocking, any bookmarking app without this feature is at a major disadvantage.  While I do wish it had a way for me to publicly share my recent bookmarks, it does absolutely everything else I want from a bookmarks and reading list manager.  \n\n### Bluesky PDS ###\n\nWhile I agree with the general sentiment that Bluesky is neither federated 'nor distributed, I never the less run a [personal data server](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds) to take what little control of my data I can.  However, as bluesky allows you to use your own domain without hosting anything, it kind of feels like all I'm doing is saving the for-profit Bluesky corporation a little bit of money on their storage bill.  There aren't any apps that do anything special with a PDS, any way to export your data or keys, or any other advantage to selfhosting on Bluesky.  \n\n### NVDARemoteServer ###\n\nAs I do sometimes need to access my machines remotely, I run [NVDA Remote Server](https://github.com/jmdaweb/NVDARemoteServer).  It's an extremely simple app with almost no configuration; I enabled automatic updates, and it's otherwise set it and forget it.

The mass adoption of OpenID for logins has meant that for many services, everyone can choose the provider that works best and is most accessible for them: Google? Apple? GitHub? Thanks to OpenID, we all generally get to pick our favourite.  Personally, I like the way Apple Presents two-factor codes to me, so use that whenever I can; I find Apple&rsquo;s two factor the easiest for me to read with my screen reader and act on.  But if your milage varies (because everyone&rsquo;s needs are different), thanks to OpenID, you can probably pick something else.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also find thriving communities of blind people on Mastodon and throughout the Fediverse.  Thanks to the open standards, open protocols, and open API&rsquo;s that the fediverse is built on, we have dozens of accessible apps to pick from. Some are specialized for our needs, and some are accessible third-party apps.</p>\n<p>And although text-based usenet is <a href=\"https://news.individual.net\">almost completely</a> gone, email remains alive and well, with dozens of accessibility communities making their homes in places like <a href=\"https://groups.io\">GroupsIO</a> and <a href=\"https://www.freelists.org\">FreeLists</a>.</p>\n<p>While the discussion about <a href=\"https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky\">just how decentralized and federated bluesky is</a> continues, it&rsquo;s openly documented nature means that third-party accessibility apps for it are also slowly beginning to emerge.</p>\n<p>I write all this in support of a controversial hot take that&rsquo;s been percolating in my brain for a while now: open Protocols and APIs are the most important feature for robust and lasting accessibility to exist.  In fact, true accessibility might not be possible without them.  An API on top of a proprietary service can be shut down or changed, as happened with Twitter.  Open source code is all well and good, but if it doesn&rsquo;t implement a robust API-first design, the results of that code won&rsquo;t be accessible; this can be seen most clearly in the current state of accessibility on the Linux desktop.  Web Standards and open formats are, of course, an important part of accessibility, but if browsers didn&rsquo;t implement API&rsquo;s like IAccessible2, assistive technology would be dead in the water.  When the protocol and API are both documented, though, apps quickly spring up to meet the needs of all users. And if the protocol is also open, as with email or IRC, the accessibility granted by those apps can never be taken away.  User Adoption, of course, is another matter entirely.  While I still maintain <a href=\"https://github.com/fastfinge/adispeak\">a project to make a modern IRC client accessible</a>, IRC&rsquo;s failure to modernize as a protocol means effectively nobody uses it.  That makes its ongoing accessibility much less meaningful than I would like.  I&rsquo;m not sure what the solution to adoption is; but I know that just like everywhere else social problems and technology intersect, it will be complicated, messy, and on-going.  Perhaps the only lesson of this article is that accessibility is as much (or more) a social problem as a technical one.</p>\n",

Some are specialized for our needs, and some are accessible third-party apps.  \n\nAnd although text-based usenet is [almost completely](https://news.individual.net) gone, email remains alive and well, with dozens of accessibility communities making their homes in places like [GroupsIO](https://groups.io) and [FreeLists](https://www.freelists.org).  \n\nWhile the discussion about [just how decentralized and federated bluesky is](https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky) continues, it's openly documented nature means that third-party accessibility apps for it are also slowly beginning to emerge.  \n\nI write all this in support of a controversial hot take that's been percolating in my brain for a while now: open Protocols and APIs are the most important feature for robust and lasting accessibility to exist.  In fact, true accessibility might not be possible without them.  An API on top of a proprietary service can be shut down or changed, as happened with Twitter.  Open source code is all well and good, but if it doesn't implement a robust API-first design, the results of that code won't be accessible; this can be seen most clearly in the current state of accessibility on the Linux desktop.  Web Standards and open formats are, of course, an important part of accessibility, but if browsers didn't implement API's like IAccessible2, assistive technology would be dead in the water.  When the protocol and API are both documented, though, apps quickly spring up to meet the needs of all users. And if the protocol is also open, as with email or IRC, the accessibility granted by those apps can never be taken away.  User Adoption, of course, is another matter entirely.  While I still maintain [a project to make a modern IRC client accessible](https://github.com/fastfinge/adispeak), IRC's failure to modernize as a protocol means effectively nobody uses it.  That makes its ongoing accessibility much less meaningful than I would like.  I'm not sure what the solution to adoption is; but I know that just like everywhere else social problems and technology intersect, it will be complicated, messy, and on-going.  Perhaps the only lesson of this article is that accessibility is as much (or more) a social problem as a technical one.\n",
