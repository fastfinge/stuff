			 <p>Just finished: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781039489868">The New Dawn: A Humorous Isekai LitRPG</a> by Icalos ðŸ“š</p>
<p>First off, this is book 5 in the Terminate The Other World series. As with most litrpg series, you can&rsquo;t just jump in; you need to start from book 1, and go in that order.  If you&rsquo;ve never read the series, I highly recommend it so long as you don&rsquo;t mind lengthy stat sheets in the first three books.  The books are well written and funny, and <a href="https://soundofsavy.com">Savy Des-Etages</a> is easily one of my favourite audiobook narrators.  In short, what happens when a cyborg terminator from a futuristic world is transported into a middle-ages world of stats and technology?  Read all five books to find out!</p>
<p>In another rarity for litrpg, this is a series with an actual end that&rsquo;s satisfying and wraps everything up nicely. There also isn&rsquo;t a stat sheet anywhere in the entire book.  I do wonder, however, if this book is weirdly deep, or just deeply weird.  By the time you get to the end, you&rsquo;ll have encountered enough realms and dimensions and plains of reality to make your head spin.  I&rsquo;m not sure if all these things were somehow connected to platonic ideals, and trying to make a deep philosophical or religious point, or if they&rsquo;re just D&amp;D/superhero inspired weirdness.  I&rsquo;m also not sure if this book represents the author chafing against the limitations of his genre, or making a larger point about the dangers of measurement and the quantified self limiting personal actualization, or if it&rsquo;s just the outgrowth of trying to figure out how to write a satisfactory ending when your main character already has pretty much every possible power in the universe.</p>
<p>Not being part of any east-Asian cultures, I also wonder a bit about characters like the celestial elves; it&rsquo;s possible this series steps over the line from making fun of wuxia tropes to making fun of cultures themselves.  Savy Des-Etages did an excellent job balancing the need to make the author intent clear, without doing cringy &ldquo;oriental&rdquo; accents most of the time.  I have the same discomfort with Beware of Chicken, though, so it&rsquo;s possible I&rsquo;m just over-sensitive.  I can&rsquo;t read any language other than English, and being blind I can&rsquo;t read subtitles at all, so I have no exposure to the artifacts these works are in dialogue with.</p>
<p>Never the less, readers who enjoyed the other four books in this series will find this is a satisfying conclusion, offering closure, and ending the journey nicely.</p>

I arrived at 8:55 AM, five minutes before voting even opened, and the line was already out the door. It moved fairly quickly, but the entire process still took over an hour. And the line kept growing as people continued to arrive.  If youâ€™re hoping to vote, be ready for that! Also: vote anyway! As for accessibility, I chose to go with a family member to assist me this time. While the Braille version was available and offered, my riding is one where a protest group has chosen to make the printed version over a meter long. I dread to think what the Braille template would be like! I also didnâ€™t want to hold up the long line by figuring it out.  The person helping me unfortunately had to complete a lengthy form, so Iâ€™m not sure that process was any faster. But the workers were well trained, and knew what needed to happen; glad to see the training continue to improve!</p>

			 <p>Read: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781039478725">The Bee-ginning: A Dungeon-Core LitRPG</a> by Icalos ðŸ“š</p>
<p>You should have been warned by the name: &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; is a perfectly accurate representation of what this is. Thus far, we&rsquo;ve had a review of a router, articles about AI, and thoughts on accessibility.  There&rsquo;s probably a review of a meet thermometer coming up in the near future; obviously, the key to gaining readers is to publish random articles on subject matter so diverse that nobody in the world could care about all of it.</p>
<p>Anyway!  This is, oddly, the second LitRPG I&rsquo;ve read about bees.  The first was <a href="https://micro.blog/books/G49350504">The Beesong Chronicles</a> by Benjamin Medrano.  But where that book focused on a single bee discovering the wider world, this book focuses on a dungeon master creating a bee dungeon. Well, a tower. Or&hellip;more of a field with lots of bees in it.</p>
<p>I do enjoy dungeon core books, but that wasn&rsquo;t the primary reason I picked this up.  I was familiar with, and really loved, the other popular series by Icalos, called terminate the other world.  Not only did the humour work for me, the narrator was also spectacular.  <a href="https://soundofsavy.com/">Savy Des-Etages</a> is so enormously talented that I could enjoy listening to her read out a long list of numbers for an hour and a half.  In fact, I have!</p>
<p>That actually marks the most noticeable improvement in this new series from terminate the other world.  While it&rsquo;s a dungeon core litrpg, and progression and advancement are still important, the stat sheet has been vastly simplified with many numbers entirely removed.  At least in the audio format, this works well. It balances a sense of numbers and progression, with telling a story and not getting bogged down in 90 minutes of reciting charts.  Terminate The Other World tried to improve on that as the series went on, but because of the nature of the plot it was stuck with several different stat sheets for a single character.</p>
<p>So how about that story and plot?  This is a fish out of water type story: a simple, impoverished peasant boy suddenly finds himself in charge of vast dungeon-like powers and resources, but with no related experience and no idea what to do.  Thankfully, there&rsquo;s always bees!  This is a slow build, with lots of character development for our anxious protagonist.  As I quite liked him, that was a plus in my book. But if you dislike him for whatever reason, this just won&rsquo;t be for you. With a few diversions, you&rsquo;re spending most of the book with him.  Also, I really have no idea about the accuracy of the beekeeping involved, but if you&rsquo;re a professional beekeeper, I could easily see you getting frustrated with it.</p>
<p>As expected from Savy, the narration is absolutely first-class.  Although this book doesn&rsquo;t give her quite as much to do, what it does give her, she executes well.  She&rsquo;s one of the few British people who can do an American accent without sounding annoying or fake.</p>
<p>Although the book is obviously the first in a series, it does end in a satisfying place, giving readers closure and completion, while also leaving things to look forward to in the next book.</p>
<p>If you already know you enjoy litRPG, dungeon core, or Icalos, you should absolutely pick up this book; if you enjoy listening, it&rsquo;s even better in audio. If you&rsquo;ve never heard of dungeon core, or litRPG, this actually wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad place to start.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://stuff.interfree.ca/2025/04/15/can-ai-help-me-read.html">Can AI help me read scans of golden-age science fiction magazines?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://stuff.interfree.ca/2025/04/15/can-ai-help-me-read.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-04-15 20:32:28 -0400">Apr 15, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve always loved golden-age pulp science fiction.  Unfortunately, the scans of magazines like astounding are generally of poor enough quality that standard OCR struggles with them.</p>
<p>So I thought: what better use for AI than reading public domain science fiction?  I downloaded a <a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_astounding-science-fiction_1955-03_55_1">random issue of Astounding Science Fiction and Fantasy from the internet archive</a>, this one printed in 1955. I started by grabbing the PDF.</p>
<p>First, I tried uploading it to Chat GPT with the following prompt: &ldquo;I love reading golden age science fiction from the public domain. Unfortunately, the magazine scans are generally not accessible, and the OCR doesn&rsquo;t do a good job. Could you produce an accessible version of this PDF?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It responded &ldquo;Iâ€™ve converted the March 1955 issue of Astounding Science Fiction into an accessible plain text version. You can download it using the link below&rdquo;. Unfortunately, the .txt file it offered me consisted of&hellip;74,498 blank lines. When I informed it of this fact, it tried to just run an OCR tool on the PDF. But that produced identical results to the OCR done by archive.org. In both cases, the first page reads like this: &ldquo;March 1955 - 35 Cents â€˜ Astoundinc
BCIENCE FICTIOw | Sense From Thnucht Nivide .. &hellip;&hellip; â€”_â€”&rdquo;.  Not really readable!</p>
<p>So I tried Google Gemini 2.5. It was more promising! It began outputting perfect versions of each page, with everything nicely marked for screen readers.  Unfortunately, it got to page 12 and timed out. Also, it sighted the source of every paragraph with a footnote that lead back to the PDF. Yes, Gemini, I know that the text came from the PDF I just uploaded to you! This is also annoying to read with a screen reader. It&rsquo;s output looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Astounding SCIENCE FICTION
Volume LV, Number 1 - March 1955
(Cover)
â€¢ Image: Sense From Thought Divide
â€¢ Price: 35 Cents
(Page 2 - Advertisement)
â€¢ NICK CARTER MASTER DETECTIVE
â€¢ Suspense-packed case histories with America&rsquo;s top fictional sleuth.
â€¢ SUNDAYS 4:30 pm EST
â€¢ MUTUAL Broadcasting System MBS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I figured: the timeout is probably because I&rsquo;m using the official gemini interface. What if I try BasiliskLLM? Unfortunately, it only supports images, not pdfs. So I thought I&rsquo;d download the raw images from the Internet Archive.  Unfortunately&hellip;they&rsquo;re in JPEG2000, and it doesn&rsquo;t support that image format!</p>
<p>Deep breaths.  Okay! How about Google Notebook? It might have longer timeouts, right?  I gave it the PDF file and the prompt, and it did the same thing Chat GPT did, and just performed basic OCR.  So I asked: &ldquo;There are lots of OCR errors. Could you correct them based on the images in the PDF?&rdquo; It gave me output like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I can certainly help you with correcting the OCR errors based on the images in the PDF. Here are some of the corrections I&rsquo;ve identified, presented by the source page number:
â€¢
Page 1 :
â—¦
&ldquo;Sense Fram Thauoht Nivide ..&rdquo; should likely be &ldquo;Sense From Thought Divide ..&rdquo;
â—¦
&ldquo;mee stounding&rdquo; should likely be &ldquo;the astounding&rdquo;
â€¢
Page 2 :
â—¦
&ldquo;ety he&rdquo; should likely be &ldquo;at the&rdquo;
â—¦
&ldquo;(LEASE PRINT) ro Mail&rdquo; should likely be &ldquo;(PLEASE PRINT) to Mail&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even deeper breaths! Not useful. Okay, but we&rsquo;re getting closer. How about if I ask &ldquo;Please provide the fully corrected text.&rdquo; It replies, &ldquo;NotebookLM canâ€™t answer this question. Try rephrasing it, or ask a different question.&rdquo;  I might pass out if I take anymore deep breaths.</p>
<p>Right, but that gives me something else to try. What about using Chat GPT canvas, changing the model to 4o, and giving a more specific prompt:
&ldquo;I love reading golden age science fiction from the public domain. Unfortunately, the magazine scans are generally not accessible, and the OCR doesn&rsquo;t do a good job. I need the text from this PDF accurately transcribed, correctly formatted , with all the text, and descriptions of any artwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Close! Unfortunately, that causes it to describe the artwork and summarize the text.  I fiddled with the prompt, but it would always start summarizing after a few pages.</p>
<p>Okay, what if we don&rsquo;t give it the PDF? Can it handle images? Let&rsquo;s modify the prompt a bit, and upload a zip file of an image of each page: &ldquo;I love reading golden age science fiction from the public domain. Unfortunately, magazine scans are not accessible, and OCR doesn&rsquo;t do a good job. I need this magazine accurately transcribed, correctly formatted , with all the text, and descriptions of any artwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once I switched to using the 4o reasoning model, that did the trick. It did the first eight pages, then asked me if I wanted any changes, or if it should continue.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the admittedly impressive sample output it gave me: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->astounding-1955-03-story1.html<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In conclusion, AI can almost, but not quite do this. The problems I had were more a matter of tooling.  If I was serious about reading these magazines regularly, for more than just entertainment value, my best bet would be to write a program to:</p>
<ul>
<li>feed AI an image of each page, and instruct it to transcribe it into markdown</li>
<li>check that the result is an expected length and contains markdown formatting</li>
<li>compare the AI page with standard inaccurate OCR, to sanity check that some of the expected text is present</li>
<li>add each page to the final markdown file, and convert it to html</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting an AI to write the code to do this is, however, left as a project for the reader.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Whenever any cutting-edge technology hits the mainstream, there&rsquo;s an explosion of creativity as people experiment with designs, try to find solutions for old problems, and create new solutions looking for a problem.  This is especially true in the accessibility industry.  It happened with the internet, web 2.0, the blockchain, and now it&rsquo;s AI&rsquo;s turn.  Three quarters of these products disappear without ever gaining adoption.  But the ones that survive change the world forever.</p>
<p>In the case of AI, I feel like I&rsquo;ve tested every single one of the available accessibility solutions.  But these are the three that stuck; they made a real difference to my personal daily life, and I find myself coming back to them, even after trying other solutions.</p>
<h3 id="basiliskllm">BasiliskLLM</h3>
<p>Named after the famous <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/w/rokos-basilisk">Roko&rsquo;s basilisk</a>, BasiliskLLM is a Windows <a href="https://github.com/SigmaNight/basiliskLLM?tab=readme-ov-file">desktop app</a> that integrates with multiple AI&rsquo;s, through multiple API providers.  It offers audio transcription, image description, access to web search, and the ability to integrate with the <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org">NVDA</a> screenreader through an addon.  It sits in the system tray, and can be activated and dismissed via a shortcut key.  It also has a tabbed interface allowing quick switching between multiple conversations, profiles for different prompts and presets, and allows switching models mid-conversation.  I use it with <a href="https://www.openrouter.ai">OpenRouter</a> so I can get access to all of the well-known AI models; that lets me, for example, quickly ask two different vision models the same question, if I want to verify the answer.  I use BasiliskLLM for describing images, answering quick questions, testing models, and verifying the state of inaccessible interfaces.  The only tool I wish it had that it&rsquo;s missing is retrieval augmented generation (RAG), to make it easier for me to give it folders of manuals and documentation.</p>
<h3 id="kai">KAI###</h3>
<p>KI is the beta multi-step assistant offered by the <a href="https://www.kagi.com">KAGI</a> search engine as part of it&rsquo;s premium plan.  While not quite as accessible as Chat GPT, it&rsquo;s still perfectly usable.  The primary issue is that switching models with the keyboard can be slightly tricky. But it can read results as they come in,the sources are easy to find and check, and the conversation interface is easy to navigate. I find that the far superior search results offered by KAGI make all the difference when I&rsquo;m doing AI research.  Garbage in, Garbage out, after all.  For anything detailed, I also find KI to be much better than using the web search functions of OpenRouter with BasiliskLLM.  As well, it offers access to all of the major AI providers (google, openAI, deepseek) for a single subscription, and allows me to switch between them whenever I like.  That plus Kagi&rsquo;s excellent search engine makes it the winner of my monthly AI subscription dollars.</p>
<h3 id="seeing-ai">Seeing AI</h3>
<p>There are dozens of AI accessibility apps on IOS, each with their advantages and disadvantages.  But no matter what I try, I keep coming back to <a href="https://www.seeingai.com">Seeing AI</a>.  First off, I like that it offers different AI&rsquo;s for different functions, instead of trying to do everything with one model. This makes the results more accurate, and allows me to focus directly on what I&rsquo;m doing: navigating the world, getting a description of a photo, scanning barcodes, identifying currency, or any of the dozens of other features it offers.  It&rsquo;s biggest disadvantage compared to other apps with AI functions (like Be My Eyes) is that it doesn&rsquo;t include the ability to reach out to a real human to verify results.  I keep <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com">Be My Eyes</a> installed on my phone as a backup for that reason.  But Seeing AI&rsquo;s speed, accuracy, stability, and dozens of available functions has kept it as my primary mobile AI app for years now.  I did, however, obtain a pair of Meta Smart Glasses recently. But I&rsquo;ve only had them for a month, so it&rsquo;s too early to say if or when they&rsquo;ll replace my beloved Seeing AI.</p>
<h3 id="tools-im-testing">Tools I&rsquo;m Testing</h3>
<p>These are the current AI based tools I&rsquo;m testing; it&rsquo;s too early to know if these will earn a spot in the toolbox or not. Expect to read more about them in the coming months!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.innosearch.ai">Innosearch AI</a>: using AI to make shopping more accessible and inclusive</li>
<li><a href="https://www.guideinteraction.com">Guide</a>: have AI control your computer to help you use inaccessible apps and websites</li>
<li>Metta Smart Glasses</li>
<li><a href="https://glidance.io">Glidance</a>: an AI device to augment the cane. Not launched yet, but I&rsquo;ve pre-ordered.</li>
<li><a href="https://typeahead.ai">TypeAhead</a>: similar to Guide for OSX</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are dozens of accessibility related AI apps and products in the marketplace, and it feels like new ones launch every day.  The above three tools are just the ones that I go to daily; the industry is moving fast enough, though, that this list could look completely different in a year.  So what tools are you using? Are your toolbox picks different from mine? Did I miss any upcoming tools I should be evaluating? Let me know!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been a happy customer of the <a href="https://amplifi.com/alien">Amplifi Alien</a> routers since they were released in December 2019.  However, they haven&rsquo;t received an upgrade since then; that means they have no support for Wifi 6E or Wifi 7.  So when one of my alien units broke, I decided it was time to invest in an entirely new mesh system now that I own Wifi 7 capable devices.  If you&rsquo;re looking for a used router on the cheap, though, I would strongly advise keeping an eye out for Amplifi Alien units. As early adopters like me begin to upgrade, I would expect to see a lot of perfectly good Wifi6 mesh router systems going for bargain prices.  The app is decently accessible, they make sounds when they reboot or lose connection, and they&rsquo;re rock solid once you get them going.  The thing that kills them is the fan. My routers go in a corner somewhere and get forgotten.  So as the fans got clogged with dust, I failed to notice until the router overheated and stopped working. If you&rsquo;re a better owner than I am, the fan openings are obvious and easy to clean.</p>
<p>But the Alien isn&rsquo;t the subject of this article.  Let&rsquo;s move on to actually talking about what the title promises.  In order to replace the Amplifi Routers, I did consider the <a href="https://ca.store.ui.com/ca/en/products/udm-pro">Ubiquity Dream Machine</a>. However, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of criticism of the controller app for being inaccessible with screen readers.  Also, Ubiquity stuff requires a lot more setup and management.  While I&rsquo;m certain I&rsquo;m capable of it, network access is absolutely critical to everyone in this house.  With two blind people living here, we&rsquo;ve invested heavily into the smart-home, if only to get devices that we can at least use via an app.  So our network is extremely busy, with tons of devices active at once, and when the network goes down, we can&rsquo;t control everything from the oven to the furnace.  I decided against building my own router with FreeBSD for similar reasons.</p>
<p>So I went looking for routers with an accessible interface that supported Wifi7 mesh, and required as little on-going management as possible.  A review on <a href="https://www.applevis.com/apps/ios/utilities/tp-link-deco">Applevis</a> suggested that the TP-Link Deco app might meet my accessibility requirements.  Researching TP-Link&rsquo;s product offerings, it looked like the <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/ca/home-networking/deco/deco-be95">Deco BE95</a> would provide everything I was looking for.</p>
<p>After owning the units for a month now, I can say that I was correct!  Before talking about all the good things, though, let&rsquo;s start off with the bad.  First, the price.  These are not cheap routers!  The hardware itself is more expensive than either Amplifi or Ubiquity gear with similar specs. Plus, on top of the purchase price, there&rsquo;s also a monthly subscription if you want some of the advanced security features.  I obviously paid the early adopter tax here. While I&rsquo;m fine with paying for routers that will last six or seven years without me ever having to touch them, be aware that there are cheaper ways to get the same features if you&rsquo;re willing to put in the work.</p>
<p>Second, the out of the box setup experience could be better.  While the app is, in fact, accessible, you do need to get someone to look at lights for you to know when the first router is ready for pairing.  But once you&rsquo;ve got the first one up, the app will notify you when your mesh unit is ready to be added.  I also disliked the default DHCP settings, and found changing them was a fiddley process that required modifying things in two separate sections of the settings.  Even after changing the DHCP settings to work with my network, the router requires a different netmask, so I had to go and modify all of my static devices that weren&rsquo;t using DHCP.  If none of that meant anything to you, don&rsquo;t worry about it; the router should just work out of the box for you.</p>
<p>Lastly, the paid security features. If having to pay a monthly router subscription isn&rsquo;t bad enough, the features just aren&rsquo;t as useful as they should be for the price.  They do include a dynamically updated blocklist, to block phishing and other security issues at the router. I have some older folks who sometimes use my network, so the feature is appreciated.  Unfortunately, though, the router provides no whitelist. If the security blocks a false positive, your only option is to turn it off entirely.  The router also provides an EOT protection feature. But nowhere that I can find does it explain what the feature actually does. I can say that in my setup it didn&rsquo;t break anything, so that&rsquo;s good. But what is it actually protecting me against? Who knows!  As part of this feature, the router provides weekly and monthly reports on my network.  Once again, though, this feature isn&rsquo;t as useful as I would like it to be.  It does include threats blocked, but even when I have the security features turned on, it constantly reminds me to scan my network and turn them on. It also reports on number of new devices connected, though it seems to struggle with naming them.  But what it doesn&rsquo;t do is provide me with a network speed report for the week or month.  That means I still have to keep my <a href="https://help.fing.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418409261458-Fingbox-Set-up-and-features">fingbox</a>.  As I pay a subscription to Fing already, it would have been nice if the Deco could have replaced those functions entirely.  It&rsquo;s really close, but just not quite there.  Perhaps software updates will add the missing features.</p>
<p>With the bad stuff out of the way, let&rsquo;s talk about the good!  First, just as Applevis indicated, the app is pretty much fully accessible. There are a few places where the back button is missing a label, and one spot where the graphs are hard to read.  But that aside, everything works perfectly.  The settings include everything from QoS to port forwarding and VLANs, and they&rsquo;re all logically laid out and easy to find.  I tripped over updating the DHCP range, because I had to change the router&rsquo;s LAN IP first, but it all made sense; I just wasn&rsquo;t expecting it.  The Deco&rsquo;s also provide a web-based user interface, though not all settings are available there.</p>
<p>My ISP offers a 3.5 gig fiber connection. However, in an oddity, it requires PPPOE. One issue I often run into is that a lot of routers aren&rsquo;t well enough equipped with CPU and RAM to handle the PPPOE overhead while giving me full speed on both wired and wifi.  I can say with pleasure that&rsquo;s not the case for Deco. I get my full speed, with lots of CPU and RAM to spare. That also means that while the units themselves get warm, the fans never have to run.</p>
<p>The routers have been managing my entire network for a month now, and they&rsquo;ve only crashed twice. The first time was because I made a silly mistake and plugged a switch into itself.  Then, thanks to Sonos, I got a packetstorm that took down my entire network.  The second time was when I ignored the router&rsquo;s warnings, and prioritized five times more than the recommended number of devices using QoS.  That caused the routers to become unstable and crash every few hours. However, removing some devices from QoS fixed that right up.</p>
<p>The backhaul between the mesh units is highly configurable.  You can have it use wired backhaul, or pick the frequency band it should save for wifi backhaul, and you can make different choices for each unit. This is the first mesh system I&rsquo;ve had where speeds on the mesh units are exactly as fast as the wireless speeds when connected to the primary router.  The wifi range is also as good as advertised, and I have no problem covering the entire property (both indoors and outdoors) with full-speed wifi and no dead zones or drop outs.</p>
<p>This is also the first router I&rsquo;ve had that makes sensible frequency decisions, without me having to intervene and set channels and bandwidths manually.  It avoids interfering with the cordless phones and Bluetooth devices, and doesn&rsquo;t sometimes drop when the microwave is running. I&rsquo;ve also had reports from hearing aid users that their wireless hearing aids no longer break up like they used to.</p>
<p>In the time I&rsquo;ve had the routers, I had one firmware update.  The process was smooth, with the routers handling everything by themselves.  They can also back-up your settings to the cloud, just in case.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you&rsquo;re looking for stable, fast wifi, with quick set-up and almost no on-going maintenance, and you&rsquo;re okay with paying a high price for it, the Deco&rsquo;s are an excellent option.  They&rsquo;re accessible, never need rebooting, and compatible with everything I threw at them. However, if you don&rsquo;t need Wifi7 and/or are willing to set up and maintain everything yourself, you could do just as well and spend less money if you put the extra time and effort into it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Note: the sounds in this entry do not contain actual words, and often are not identifiable sounds. This post is inaccessible to the Deaf or Hard of Hearing. I have done my best to describe the sounds in the entry itself, however I recognize that any level of inaccessibility to any person for any reason is unacceptable.  In an attempt to offset this, I have donated $75 to the <a href="https://deafculturecentre.ca/donate">Canadian Cultural Society of the Deaf</a>. I strongly encourage anyone who listens to any of the sounds on this page to do the same.</p>
<p>There has been a good deal of discussion about how well AI represents people with disabilities, both in image and text generation.  However, as AI has continued to advance, more mediums have become available.  How well does state of the art AI represent the sounds of disability?</p>
<p>In order to find out, I asked <a href="https://www.elevenlabs.io">Eleven Labs</a> to generate sounds that are part of the fabric of the daily lives of people with disabilities.  I kept all of the settings (length, influence, etc) at there defaults.</p>
<h3 id="text-to-speech">Text To Speech</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a blind screenreader user, the sound of text to speech is an enormous part of your every day reality. But how well does AI understand it?</p>
<p>I started off by asking it for arguably the most well-known and historically significant text to speech system: the votrax.  Created by Federal Screw Works and featured in everything from the Q*bert video game to the original Braille &lsquo;N Speak, the Votrax was what really got consumer accessible text to speech started.  If you&rsquo;ve never heard it, it sounds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6J7bx8Z9aA">like this</a>.</p>
<p>The prompt: &ldquo;The Votrax text to speech synthesizer&rdquo;.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Hmmm, pretty darn close!  I didn&rsquo;t ask it to say anything in particular, so I can&rsquo;t ding it for saying gibberish.</p>
<p>But can it tell the difference between different text to speech systems?  Created by Denis Klatt and used by Steven Hawking, the DECtalk synthesizer is easily the second most influential text to speech system.  If you&rsquo;ve never heard it before, it sounds a bit like this:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So what does AI make of it?  Well&hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Amusingly, it was obviously trying to introduce itself as DECtalk. But it sounds <em>nothing</em> like it!  In fact, it sounds just like the Votrax.  Seems like Eleven Labs was only trained on one text to speech system.</p>
<h3 id="the-white-cane">The White Cane</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been to a camp or conference widely attended by blind people, or a school for the blind, the sound of white canes clacking down the hallway or sidewalk is a familiar one.  If you&rsquo;ve never heard it before, it&rsquo;s a rhythmic tapping, in time with the traveler&rsquo;s footsteps.  But is it familiar to AI? I asked Eleven Labs to generate &ldquo;the sound of someone using the two point touch technique with a white cane&rdquo;.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Apparently&hellip;no!  That&rsquo;s obviously a cow walking in traffic.</p>
<p>Maybe that was too specialized?  What about just &ldquo;Using a white cane&rdquo;.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is the sound of a Ninja whacking something. If they are blind, whatever they&rsquo;re doing is not appropriate usage of a white cane.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of my other prompts did any better.  Asking for people Writing Braille, the sound of a Braille embosser, the alarm from a talking watch, and every other sound I could think of resulted in either garbled speech or clips of music.</p>
<h3 id="wheelchairs">Wheelchairs</h3>
<p>Maybe AI can do better with &ldquo;An electric wheelchair stopping and starting&rdquo;?  Back in my university days, I dated a person who used an electric wheelchair, and was friends with another. The sounds of the beeps as they use the joystick to control the chair, and the humming of the electric motor and wheels, are something I&rsquo;m quite familiar with.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And I can tell you from personal experience that the sound of some kind of toy car hitting a ramp is not at all close.</p>
<h3 id="diabetes">Diabetes</h3>
<p>What about the sound of injecting the latest wonder drug, Ozempic?  This is something my own father does every week, so I&rsquo;m quite familiar with the unique clicking sound it makes as he uses it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is just what the Eleven Labs AI does when it has no idea: music and someone speaking in gibberish.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe that was too specialized. What about  the sound of an insulin pump? I&rsquo;m far less familiar with that sound, but a girl who attended my church as a teenager had one, and one of my current co-workers also has one. So I am, at least, pretty sure what they don&rsquo;t sound like.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t sound at all like a toy shotgun clicking.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Most AI starts off as a strange novelty that people make fun of; it happened with machine translation, captions, and text and image generation.  But the same AI quickly gains mainstream acceptance over time, with only minor improvements.  I suspect sound effect generation is on the same trajectory.  I can only hope that Hollywood doesn&rsquo;t start getting disability related sound effects from AI any time soon.</p>
<p>Can you think of any disability related sound effects I missed? Post them in the comments! Also, don&rsquo;t forget to smash that bell icon and&hellip;oh gosh&hellip;I feel dirty even writing this.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been hosting services for myself and others for over 25 years now: starting on IIS6, moving to Windows Server, eventually to Debian, and now to an entirely dockerized stack.  Self-hosting allows me to control my destiny in a way that using cloud services run by others doesn&rsquo;t.  If an update causes screenreader issues, I can just not apply it. If I don&rsquo;t like the default themes, I can change them. In most cases, the projects I host are open-source, meaning I can contribute fixes myself, or write plugins to meet my specific accessibility needs.  In this article, I&rsquo;ll go over the tech choices I&rsquo;ve currently made, why I made those choices, and how they&rsquo;re working out for me.  As it can be disappointing to set up and configure an app for hosting, only to find out it doesn&rsquo;t work with your screenreader, I thought it would be a good idea to document what I&rsquo;m currently using.  If you&rsquo;re interested in taking the same control yourself, or just curious about the accessibility of the self-hosting landscape, I hope you&rsquo;ll find this post useful and informative.</p>
<p>Note:  where I mention paid services, I have no relationship with those companies and organizations beyond being a customer.  I intentionally did not include referral codes, and I receive no compensation for discussing them.</p>
<h3 id="dns-email-and-domains">DNS, email, and Domains</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a satisfied customer of <a href="https://easydns.com">EasyDNS</a> for all of my DNS and domain hosting needs since 2004.  Their legacy control panels have always been fully accessible, and when they rolled out the new beta of the DNS editor, it was completely accessible from the get-go.  I&rsquo;ve also used their email hosting for several projects, and had excellent delivery rates, with well-supported and documented imap and smtp settings that have always worked with the email clients of my choice.  The few times I&rsquo;ve needed to interact with support they&rsquo;ve been friendly, quick, and helpful.  Plus, they&rsquo;re a Canadian company with offices in Toronto that&rsquo;s been around since 1998.  What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>
<h3 id="vps-hosting">VPS Hosting</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always avoided the major clouds as hosting providers; I want my data hosted in Canada, and I want to support small businesses. This has meant I&rsquo;ve moved servers many times over the years, as companies come and go.  While it&rsquo;s a bit of effort, at least it means I know my backup and migration strategies work well!  My current pick for server hosting is <a href="https://servarica.com">ServaRica</a>.  The website is largely accessible, the prices are reasonable, support is quick, and the data center is in Montreal.  They also offer specialized VPS plans for applications that require large amounts of storage, meaning I don&rsquo;t have to purchase storage from S3.</p>
<h3 id="management-and-orchestration">Management and Orchestration</h3>
<p>The solution I&rsquo;m currently happiest with for managing everything is <a href="https://cosmos-cloud.io">Cosmos Cloud</a>.  Perfectly suited for individuals and small organizations, it gives you a reverse proxy, VPN, single sign on provider, backups, a firewall, and web-based docker management and monitoring out of the box.  Best of all, it uses standard tools behind the scenes.  If it doesn&rsquo;t offer a feature or app I need, or part of the web interface has accessibility issues, I can fall back to the command line, and everything will remain just as integrated as if I&rsquo;d used Cosmos Cloud&rsquo;s management interface.  That&rsquo;s not only an accessibility win, it also means that I&rsquo;m not locked into Cosmos Cloud if I&rsquo;d ever like to change things down the road.</p>
<h3 id="file-storage-and-sync">File Storage and Sync</h3>
<p>In order to get files where they need to be, and keep the things that need keeping, I currently use a combination of <a href="https://rclone.org">rClone</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/kubo">Kubo</a>.  My eventual hopes and dreams are to move everything over to NFS and ZFS, but that&rsquo;s going to be a good deal of planning and work that I just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to mapping out yet.  In the meantime, rClone works well for moving large files like backups around, and Kubo makes for a decent combination of storage provider and CDN.</p>
<h3 id="my-home-on-the-fediverse">My Home on The Fediverse</h3>
<p>There is a massive community of people with disabilities, accessibility practitioners, and fellow leftists on Mastodon and other Activity pub compatible services.  In order to interact with them, I host my identity (@fastfinge@interfree.ca) using <a href="https://iceshrimp.dev/iceshrimp/iceshrimp.net">Iceshrimp.NET</a>.  While the accessibility of the built-in interface isn&rsquo;t yet perfect, Iceshrimp.NET uses an API first model of development.  That means it&rsquo;s fully compatible with all of my favourite apps (Enafore in my case), and even has swagger built-in to help me understand and interact with any Iceshrimp.NET specific endpoints.  As a bonus, it&rsquo;s even written in C#, a language I enjoy working with.  Unless you depend on Tweesecake or TWBlue, two apps that only support standard Mastodon, I strongly encourage giving iceshrimp.NET a look if you&rsquo;d like to host your own fediverse server.</p>
<h3 id="forums">Forums</h3>
<p>Of course, I also host the servers for <a href="https://www.rblind.com">RBlind</a>, a <a href="https://join-lemmy.org">Lemmy</a> instance.  In general, the developers are responsive to accessibility feedback, and updates and maintenance are quick and easy.  However, Lemmy is by far the service I host that takes the largest amount of resource, both in disc space and ram.  As well, deploying Lemmy yourself without following the developer provided templates can be a bit fiddly; different URLs need to go to different services, based not just on the hostname or path of the URL, but also on the HTTP headers provided by the client.  It&rsquo;s also important to know that the Lemmy developers are tanky style communists, with a track record of genocide denial, revisionist history, and censorship.  But that doesn&rsquo;t affect the overall code quality or the ability to file bugs and pull requests.  It&rsquo;s possible to run the software without supporting the views of the creators.  In my opinion, that&rsquo;s the entire point of open-source selfhosting.</p>
<h3 id="chat">Chat</h3>
<p>In an excess of optimism, I run the <a href="https://ergo.chat/about">Ergo</a> IRC server, as it&rsquo;s the server that supports the largest number of the <a href="https://ircv3.net/software/servers">IRCV3</a> features.  However, as most projects don&rsquo;t use IRC anymore, I also run the <a href="https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit">Conduwuit</a> matrix homeserver.  While Ergo was easy to set up and never breaks, getting Conduwuit to even run took me hours and hours. Conduwuit still restarts once an hour or so, sometimes randomly loses my encryption keys, and I have absolutely no idea why.  I pride myself on keeping up with modern technology&hellip;but IRC is one of my &ldquo;old man yells at cloud&rdquo; moments.  It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s easy, and it just works!  Why does everyone want Matrix, again?  IRC was good enough for us in 1995, and it remains good enough for us today!</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>For secure storage and sharing of notes, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/packages/server/README.md">Joplin</a>.  All of the cross-platform clients are accessible, the server is easy to set up, and the encryption offers security without getting in the way.</p>
<h3 id="rss">RSS</h3>
<p>My RSS reader of choice is <a href="https://miniflux.app">Miniflux</a>.  It works with all of the major RSS readers, as well as having a minimalist and accessible web interface that&rsquo;s a delight to use.  It&rsquo;s a single, self-contained binary that&rsquo;s quick and doesn&rsquo;t require many resources other than a small PostgreSQL database.</p>
<h3 id="url-shortening">URL Shortening</h3>
<p>While URL shorteners aren&rsquo;t ideal, either from a security or preservation perspective, they&rsquo;re still sometimes needed. The increased character limit of Mastodon and other social networks has obviated the need for them online, but they&rsquo;re still useful in person.  If I&rsquo;m giving a URL out over the phone, posting it on a sign or poster, or mentioning it during a presentation, I like to have a custom and easy to remember web address.  I use <a href="https://github.com/Lynx-Shortener/Lynx">Lynx</a> for this purpose, largely because it doesn&rsquo;t come with much built-in tracking.  I neither need or want to know the country, browser, operating system, and underwear size of anyone who uses one of my shortened URLs.</p>
<h3 id="file-distribution">File Distribution</h3>
<p>When I need to distribute files too large for email attachments, I use <a href="https://github.com/eikek/sharry">Sharry</a>. It allows for password protected and time limited files, direct downloads or a fancy page with previews, offering multiple files through a single link, and providing a way for others to upload large files to me.  It does all the things that services like sendspace are otherwise known for.</p>
<h3 id="bookmark-management">Bookmark Management</h3>
<p>I store both my bookmarks and my reading list in <a href="https://readeck.org/en">readeck</a>.  The major advantage is that it has a browser extension, allowing me to bookmark and save the page my browser actually received.  In the current environment of AI crawlers and website blocking, any bookmarking app without this feature is at a major disadvantage.  While I do wish it had a way for me to publicly share my recent bookmarks, it does absolutely everything else I want from a bookmarks and reading list manager.</p>
<h3 id="bluesky-pds">Bluesky PDS</h3>
<p>While I agree with the general sentiment that Bluesky is neither federated &rsquo;nor distributed, I never the less run a <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds">personal data server</a> to take what little control of my data I can.  However, as bluesky allows you to use your own domain without hosting anything, it kind of feels like all I&rsquo;m doing is saving the for-profit Bluesky corporation a little bit of money on their storage bill.  There aren&rsquo;t any apps that do anything special with a PDS, any way to export your data or keys, or any other advantage to selfhosting on Bluesky.</p>
<h3 id="nvdaremoteserver">NVDARemoteServer</h3>
<p>As I do sometimes need to access my machines remotely, I run <a href="https://github.com/jmdaweb/NVDARemoteServer">NVDA Remote Server</a>.  It&rsquo;s an extremely simple app with almost no configuration; I enabled automatic updates, and it&rsquo;s otherwise set it and forget it.  Though with NVDA making the Remote addon part of the main codebase, it&rsquo;s possible that will change in future.</p>
<h3 id="things-im-looking-for">Things I&rsquo;m looking for</h3>
<p>Currently none of the monitoring dashboards are accessible. Cosmos Cloud gives me the basics, and that&rsquo;s all that I&rsquo;ve needed so far.  But if I ever wanted to understand uptime and resource usage by endpoint over several months, I&rsquo;d be at a bit of a loss.  Similarly, the command line remains the only decent way to examine logs.</p>
<p>All of the advanced AI testing and usage interfaces are inaccessible. I currently use <a href="https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern">SillyTavern</a> with an <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/503246-sillytavern-screenreader-accessibility-fixes">accessibility userscript</a>, but it&rsquo;s far from ideal.  I know Taylor Arndt (@tayarndt@techopolis.social) was working on a <a href="https://github.com/tayarndt/open-webui">more accessible fork of openwebui</a>, but I&rsquo;m not sure how far she got.</p>
<h3 id="things-i-intentionally-dont-selfhost">Things I intentionally don&rsquo;t selfhost</h3>
<p>I ran my own email server for years.  However, with modern DNS blocklists, and the increasing centralization of email providers, it&rsquo;s just not worth it.  Getting your emails delivered today requires a company with one or more full-time experts working on the problem.</p>
<p>This blog is, in fact, not selfhosted.  The available selfhosted solutions either had accessibility issues, were overly complicated to configure and build, or had features I didn&rsquo;t want and would never use.  Writing the content is hard enough; I&rsquo;m just not that interested in setting up a deployment workflow for a static website, building Hugo by hand, or troubleshooting a PHP or NodeJS app.</p>
<p>More than anything, living productively as a person with a disability requires pragmatism.  We have to balance control, freedom, efficiency, independence, and ability in a delicate dance.  My self-hosting toolbox reflects that ongoing give and take.  My choices might not be right for you; you may want to do much more, or much less.  But if you&rsquo;re growing in tech freedom and agency, whatever you&rsquo;re doing, you&rsquo;re on the right path.</p>

		<a href="https://stuff.interfree.ca/2025/04/09/open-protocols-and-apis-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-04-09 22:55:07 -0400">Apr 9, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Note: the following are my personal opinions, and should not necessarily be taken as the opinion of my employer.Back in the day, when I was a larval teenaged geek, one of the first projects I ever created was called mircspeech. It was a script for the then popular <a href="https://www.mirc.com">mIRC</a> client, that interfaced it with the <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws">Jaws For Windows</a> screen reader.  This allowed any blind or visually impaired person to join any of the chatrooms of the day. The IRC protocol was used by the chat features of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Comic_Chat">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071017114006/http://icq.com/ircqnet/help/index.html">ICQ</a>, and everyone in between.</p>
<p>Even as the 2000&rsquo;s turned into the 2010&rsquo;s, and the popularity of IRC began to wane, most popular services like <a href="https://guidebeta.slack.com/account/gateways">slack</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/hunterbridges/ab095066d40f2e1a243e">Twitch</a> continued to support connecting with an IRC client.  But that wouldn&rsquo;t last forever.  Discord never built an official gateway, Slack eventually shut there&rsquo;s down, and using a standard IRC client with Twitch is a good deal harder than it used to be.</p>
<p>For blind people, this meant that instead of choosing the software that worked best for us, we needed to use the official apps for each service. Some of these apps were accessible, some became so, and some are still on the journey.  Regardless, none of the apps offered the degree of customization allowed by services using open protocols.</p>
<p>We saw the same pattern happen with Twitter.  Originally, Twitter offered an open and freely available API. While the official client and website had accessibility challenges, a plethora of more accessible clients sprung up to meet the accessibility needs of users: <a href="https://www.chrishofstader.com/chicken-nugget-accessible-twitter-client-released">chicken nugget</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue">TWBlue</a>, <a href="https://qwitter-client.net">qwitter</a>, <a href="https://randylaptop.com/software/jawter-2/all/1">jawter</a>, <a href="https://tweesecake.app">Tweesecake</a>, and many, many more.  But when the Twitter API was restricted and shut down, all of this accessibility work was lost.  Once again, people with disabilities had to use the official app, and could no longer customize the service to their needs.</p>
<p>Most recently, the story repeated itself once more with Reddit.  Specialty apps developed to meet the needs of screen-reader users like <a href="https://redditforblind.org">Reddit For Blind</a>, <a href="https://www.nathantech.net/products/software/lunareddit.php">Luna</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dystopia-for-reddit/id1430599061">Dystopia</a> were heavily impacted by the changes Reddit made to its API, pushing everyone to use the official Reddit app.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s been all bad news. The mass adoption of OpenID for logins has meant that for many services, everyone can choose the provider that works best and is most accessible for them: Google? Apple? GitHub? Thanks to OpenID, we all generally get to pick our favourite.  Personally, I like the way Apple Presents two-factor codes to me, so use that whenever I can; I find Apple&rsquo;s two factor the easiest for me to read with my screen reader and act on.  But if your milage varies (because everyone&rsquo;s needs are different), thanks to OpenID, you can probably pick something else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also find thriving communities of blind people on Mastodon and throughout the Fediverse.  Thanks to the open standards, open protocols, and open API&rsquo;s that the fediverse is built on, we have dozens of accessible apps to pick from. Some are specialized for our needs, and some are accessible third-party apps.</p>
<p>And although text-based usenet is <a href="https://news.individual.net">almost completely</a> gone, email remains alive and well, with dozens of accessibility communities making their homes in places like <a href="https://groups.io">GroupsIO</a> and <a href="https://www.freelists.org">FreeLists</a>.</p>
<p>While the discussion about <a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky">just how decentralized and federated bluesky is</a> continues, it&rsquo;s openly documented nature means that third-party accessibility apps for it are also slowly beginning to emerge.</p>
<p>I write all this in support of a controversial hot take that&rsquo;s been percolating in my brain for a while now: open Protocols and APIs are the most important feature for robust and lasting accessibility to exist.  In fact, true accessibility might not be possible without them.  An API on top of a proprietary service can be shut down or changed, as happened with Twitter.  Open source code is all well and good, but if it doesn&rsquo;t implement a robust API-first design, the results of that code won&rsquo;t be accessible; this can be seen most clearly in the current state of accessibility on the Linux desktop.  Web Standards and open formats are, of course, an important part of accessibility, but if browsers didn&rsquo;t implement API&rsquo;s like IAccessible2, assistive technology would be dead in the water.  When the protocol and API are both documented, though, apps quickly spring up to meet the needs of all users. And if the protocol is also open, as with email or IRC, the accessibility granted by those apps can never be taken away.  User Adoption, of course, is another matter entirely.  While I still maintain <a href="https://github.com/fastfinge/adispeak">a project to make a modern IRC client accessible</a>, IRC&rsquo;s failure to modernize as a protocol means effectively nobody uses it.  That makes its ongoing accessibility much less meaningful than I would like.  I&rsquo;m not sure what the solution to adoption is; but I know that just like everywhere else social problems and technology intersect, it will be complicated, messy, and on-going.  Perhaps the only lesson of this article is that accessibility is as much (or more) a social problem as a technical one.</p>

			 <p>Okay, after a bit more fiddling, I think I&rsquo;ve solved at least a few of my problems.</p>
<p>First, the books shortcode formatting is incorrect on the micro.blog plugin page. If you use the formatting from GitHub, it&rsquo;ll work.  This looks like a third party plugin, so I can&rsquo;t bash the service itself too hard for this one. Just some spaces that went missing somehow. As I&rsquo;ve never used Hugo before, the mistake wasn&rsquo;t obvious to me.</p>
<p>Second, importing chrome bookmarks.  You need the chrome extension &ldquo;bookmark export/import&rdquo;. You can get it from: <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-importexport/gdhpeilfkeeajillmcncaelnppiakjhn">chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bo&hellip;</a></p>
<p>To use it, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>after opening the extension from the toolbar, select the advanced option, and change the format to CSV.</li>
<li>press settings, and make sure icon metadata is off, last modified times are off, hide root folder is off, and hide parent folders are off.</li>
<li>After exporting the CSV file, open it in notepad, and change the first line to the following (including quotes): &ldquo;Title&rdquo;,&ldquo;URL&rdquo;,&ldquo;Folder&rdquo;,&ldquo;Timestamp&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>That should work!</p>

			 <p>I originally was looking for a self-hosted, federated blog, that wasn&rsquo;t American and didn&rsquo;t rely on US servers.  The options I explored were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ghost: depends on mailgun (US tech)</li>
<li>Plume: not maintained</li>
<li>write freely: not accessible</li>
<li>Wordpress: made by American big tec, requires PHP</li>
</ul>
<p>Micro.blog is American and not selfhosted, but at least it&rsquo;s small tech.  So I thought I&rsquo;d give it a whirl.  Unfortunately, my initial impressions are not promising.</p>
<p>First, getting stuff copied to european servers for an initial blog took some doing. I think the intent is you start in the US, then move to the EU, or something. But it took quite a bit of fiddling to get my domain to even save.</p>
<p>Second, I keep my bookmarks in Google Chrome.  It looks like none of the html bookmark import options can import a chrome export. They say they found several hundred bookmarks, then don&rsquo;t actually import anything. No errors in the logs.</p>
<p>Third, the plugin to embed my Finished reading bookshelf just&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t work. Once again, No error anywhere, nothing. Just displays no books.</p>
<p>Fourth, the google chrome extension is unavailable.  Not even an error about it being unsupported, it&rsquo;s just gone. And it&rsquo;s not in any of the other stores like the edge store, so those of us running other chromium based browsers can&rsquo;t get it. Maybe this is the way to import chrome bookmarks? If so, it&rsquo;s impossible to actually use.</p>
<p>Yes, I recognize this is a small business, probably with one or two employees.  However, because they&rsquo;ve chosen to create a closed-source proprietary platform, they&rsquo;re unable to keep up with the existing featureset, and nobody else can dive in to help.</p>
